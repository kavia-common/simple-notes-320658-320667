# Simple Notes — Documentation Index

This folder is the starting point for project documentation beyond the root README. The project is a small React single-page app that stores notes locally in the browser and does not rely on a backend.

## Read first

If you are new to the repository, start with these READMEs:

- [Repository README](../README.md): High-level overview, quick start, data storage model, and test command.
- [Frontend README](../notes_app_frontend/README.md): Detailed feature description, local storage key, and frontend structure.

## Product and UX documentation (placeholders)

These documents do not exist yet in this repository, but this section reserves space for them as the project grows.

### User guide (placeholder)

Intended content: How to use the app (create, edit, save, discard, delete, search), including keyboard shortcuts.
